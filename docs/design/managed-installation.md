# Managed desktop installation and background service

Implementation: **included in this source version, introduced in [PR #81](https://github.com/TED-H-com/bat-agent-connector/pull/81)** (2026-10-10). Match package evidence to the exact source commit and consult the linked checks for validation records. Older published release assets are historical client packages and do not automatically contain this runtime.

This contract covers the ordinary local installation and its advanced external-central alternative. Python Connector / Task Service remains the sole business authority. Windows Fleet manages local connection and startup choices; BAT executes work on the selected hosts. Rust owns packaging, native credentials, windows and restricted lifecycle controls, not another task journal or scheduler.

## Implemented first-use journey

1. Install a matching Windows, Mac or Linux candidate package. It includes the matching Python runtime; the user does not first install Python, uv or developer tools.
2. Launch the application. It verifies the bundled artifact, prepares private local data, one owned Python central and a personal identity, then connects the shared Dashboard. No endpoint, actor or copied API token is required for this local path.
3. In **Get ready to work**, select an importable BAT profile or enter the actual endpoint, trusted fingerprint, profile ID and BAT token. Encrypted or damaged external profile credentials remain unavailable. Saving probes the host without dispatching work or bypassing trust.
4. Configure managed permissions, dedicated remote roots and an existing trusted SSH alias where required. Select exact host/workspace/repository bindings and provider authorization. Repository setup reads BAT/GitHub; it does not push, create a PR or merge. Task Service verification settings accept explicit argv and a bounded timeout; saving does not execute them.
5. Open Web through **Open Dashboard in browser** or the tray/menu-bar entry. A private one-use handoff signs into the same personal identity. The long-lived bearer never enters command arguments, URLs, browser storage or logs.
6. Choose **Start when I sign in** for installation-owned autostart. Closing the browser or Dashboard window does not stop central work. On Windows, selected Fleet connections and BAT profile startup retain their own configuration and ownership rules.

Existing external-central configuration stays selected. **Advanced: join an existing central** requires explicit native confirmation and separate credential enrollment. It preserves the existing owned background service and never forwards its credential to the new address. Failure to reach an external service cannot provision a second database.

## Ownership, identity and storage

- The persistent installation manifest binds runtime version, data location, installation actor, server ID and principal ID. Reopening and concurrent clients recover that installation.
- Central uses kernel file leases, not an occupied port, stale PID or matching path, to enforce a single owner. The endpoint pointer is checked against the owned database, then a challenge verifies the live service before any bearer is sent.
- Windows uses private ACLs, verified handles, reparse rejection and native locking. POSIX uses private owned directories/files and process locks. These protections also cover journal, token and atomic configuration publication.
- The package pins its compressed runtime and executable digests. Installation does not download and execute an unversioned script. The frozen runtime starts without Python or uv on the user's PATH.
- Browser handoff is short-lived and single-use. The resulting session uses an HttpOnly SameSite cookie plus origin/CSRF checks; this is not a public unauthenticated hosting mode.
- Setup mutations use central durable actions, opaque staged credential references and the reviewed configuration revision. Publication is atomic. Recovery reads the original revision/receipt rather than inventing a new intent; live configuration changes wait for a safe point.

On Windows, a private reader can temporarily block replacement of a manifest or
endpoint pointer. Atomic replacement retries only native rename errors 5 and 32,
with at most six attempts and a 500 ms retry deadline. Every attempt checks the
private parent and target again, retaining the same pinned directory and flushed
temporary file. Persistent contention preserves the original error and target;
cleanup cannot hide the original failure. ACL, reparse and hard-link checks,
handle sharing and immutable artifact publication keep their existing rules.

## Background recovery and upgrades

Network recovery retries connections and reads, not a possibly accepted start, prompt, integration, merge or deployment. Original operation IDs, request keys, reservations and receipts remain authoritative. Manual and unknown resources remain read-only unless existing creation evidence proves the managed identity.

A newer bundled runtime proves ownership and asks the current central to stop safely. Active/nonterminal work blocks this transition. The launcher holds its lock through shutdown and replacement, waits for the owned kernel lease, then starts and verifies the new runtime against the same journal and identity. It never kills a PID found in a pointer. Downgrades and unknown version ordering are refused. Interrupted upgrades recover the same saved installation.

Each distributed core change requires a distinct increasing three-part Python
package/runtime version (`pyproject.toml`, `__version__` and the lockfile). The
bundled manifest must match the actual executable's version readback. The desktop
package version also increases for a new distribution. Updating only the desktop
version is insufficient: `ensure` deliberately reuses a verified running core of
the same runtime version. Development commits do not each need a version bump;
release preparation fixes the next package identity before final validation.

The published update candidate pairs core `0.2.10` with desktop `0.1.6`. Its packaged
upgrade fixture builds the published core `0.2.6` from fixed source
`f31e7964c627e4b6d3af2e2370e7a38c64a20e25` and compares the two actual payloads.
Earlier `0.2.4` → `0.2.5` receipts remain historical evidence for their original
candidates. Version declarations alone are preparation, not proof of a passing
package build, published release or upgrade of an operator's installation.

Expired/revoked credentials, invalid manifests, changed identity or missing ready-state data are recovery failures. They do not cause automatic credential reissue, deletion of history or replacement ownership. Reinstallation reuses preserved application data; deliberately deleting that data is outside ordinary reopen/upgrade behavior.

Explicit desktop Quit follows the existing Fleet shutdown guards and leaves the independent central service running. Stopping the managed service is separate and requires its own verified owner and safe-stop checks.

## Evidence and delivery boundary

Candidate source and fixture locations:

| Boundary | Source / automated fixture |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime ownership, identity, restart, upgrade and refusal | `managed_runtime.py`; `tests/test_managed_runtime.py` |
| Private storage and Windows portability | `platform_files.py`, `windows_files.py`; `tests/test_platform_files.py`, `tests/test_windows_central.py` |
| Guided setup, read-only probes and revision recovery | `managed_setup.py`; `tests/test_managed_setup.py` |
| Browser handoff and shared setup | `browser_sessions.py`; `tests/test_browser_sessions.py`, `desktop/tests/managed-setup-browser-integration.mjs` |
| Bundled integrity, empty child PATH and concurrent clients | `desktop/scripts/build-managed-runtime.py`, `desktop/tests/managed-runtime-fixture.py` |
| Distinct old/new packaged cores, retained workspace/history and busy refusal | `desktop/tests/managed-upgrade-fixture.py --previous-resources <old-bundle-directory> --current-resources <new-bundle-directory>` |
| Native installation/login lifecycle | `desktop/src-tauri/src/managed.rs`, `managed_login.rs`; platform jobs in `.github/workflows/desktop.yml` |

Use the [current main checks](https://github.com/TED-H-com/bat-agent-connector/actions?query=branch%3Amain) and [desktop workflow](https://github.com/TED-H-com/bat-agent-connector/actions/workflows/desktop.yml?query=branch%3Amain) for validation by source commit. Match the package to a successful run from the current public history; historical PR artifacts are not the download source. Package fixtures use controlled temporary resources; a successful job is evidence for its source commit and platform, not every user environment.

The packaged upgrade fixture requires two original manifest/payload pairs with
different binary digests and increasing actual versions. It verifies concurrent
upgrade clients, original identity and PM workspace, original operation key and
history, restart, and downgrade refusal. A separate synthetic uncertain operation
must keep its old owner and original intent while blocking replacement. Its
explicitly launched fixture process tree is reaped for teardown; the product never
kills an owner to upgrade. Passing output includes both binary digests and cleanup.
This supplements clean-profile installation evidence; it does not establish an
in-place app installer upgrade or acceptance of an operator's existing data.

The owner explicitly excluded formal signing, Mac notarization, production update channels and Linux persistent native credential enrollment from this delivery. Full human execution of the 46-item real-environment acceptance matrix is user-owned and is not an outstanding agent task. Exclusion does not mean these capabilities or checks were completed. Unknown native BAT merge acknowledgements preserve original work under the [merge contract](worktree-merge.md); its separate human-adjudication API is not a delivery gate.
